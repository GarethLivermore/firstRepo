This application will prepare a Linux VM on your computer using vagrant.
It will then install mysql and git on the VM.
Then it will git clone a repo containing the northwind database and clone a repo containing sql queries inclding JOINS and files containing their expected outputs.
The application will then run the same queries and test them against their expected outputs.
All tests should pass (If they do not then refer to the sql select statements and expected outputs found in https://github.com/GarethLivermore/firstRepo.git to clarify manually)


Step 1: Open a command prompt window in the Vagrant directory.
Step 2: Run command Vagrant-Up-Ubuntu
Step 3: Wait until the test completion messages appear.
The application is now complete.
